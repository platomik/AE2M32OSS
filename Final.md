Interferometric sensors
==============
Intor
**Interferometeric sensor** is an instrument based on the interference of waves.[1] There are IS for sound waves and electromagnetic waves (optical and radio waves). 

An acoustic IS is an instrument for measuring the physical characteristics of sound waves in a gas or liquid. It may be used to measure velocity, wavelength, absorption, or impedance.[2-3] It can also be used for measuring the acoustic attenuation coefficient of the medium, but the accuracy is not high. [10] 
A vibrating crystal creates the ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed parallel to the crystal. The waves are then reflected back to the source and measured.

Optical IS are used for measuring optical wavelength of spectral lines, refractive index of transparent media[4], absolute and relative measurements of length[5-7], angular diameter of objects in the sky [8], testing the quality of surfaces in the optical industry[9].

Principle of operation. Fundamental princilples.
The principles behind all types of IS are very similar. However there is just difference in coherent waves getting and in measurable value. A single beam of light will be split into two or more coherent beams by some kind of splitter device. Each of these beams travels a different optical route and are recombined before arriving a detector. Finally the result of interference between them are shown on a screen. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend on many parameters: the method of the beam splitting into coherent beams, amount of interfering beams, difference in optical distance, light intensity, the nature of the light source, the spectrum of the light.

Techniques of a coherent waves producing in IS are very various therefore many IS construtcions are exist. Optical IS can be divided into two-wave interferometers and multibeam interferometers by the number of interfering beams. Multibeam IS are used as an interference spectrum analyzer for spectral composition of light. Two-wave IS are used as an interference spectrum analyzer and an device for physical measurements.

Michelson interferometer is an example for the two-wave IS (Figure 1. from [1]). 

A Michelson interferometer consists of two highly polished mirrors M1 and M2. A source L emits light that goes through lens O1 and hits semitransparent plate P1 that splits beam into two coherent waves 1 and 2.  
P1 is partially reflective, so one beam is transmitted through to point B while the other is reflected in the direction of C. 
These beams are reflected by the mirrors M1 and M2. Then they go back in direction A but beam 2 goes through semitransparent plate P1 and beam 1 are reflected by it and after transmission of the semitransparent plate they join again. Both beams goes through lens O2 and produce an interference pattern visible to the observer at point D.

Figure 1. Path of light in Michelson interferometer.

Observed interference pattern is equal to interference in air produced by mirror M2 and virtual pattern M'1 of mirror M2 on semitransparent plate P1.

Оптич. разность хода при этом равна: D=2(AC-АВ)=2l, где l — расстояние между M2 и M'1. 

Если зеркало М1 расположено так, что М'1 и М2 параллельны, то образуются полосы равного наклона, локализованные в фокальной плоскости объектива O2 и имеющие форму концентрич. колец. Если же M2 и М'1 образуют возд. клин, то возникают полосы равной толщины, локализованные в плоскости клина M2M'1 и представляющие собой параллельные линии.
