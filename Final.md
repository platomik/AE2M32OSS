Interferometric sensors
==============

Intro
**Interferometeric sensor** is an instrument based on the interference of waves.[1] There are IS for sound waves and electromagnetic waves (optical and radio waves). 

An acoustic IS is an instrument for measuring the physical characteristics of sound waves in gases or liquids. It may be used to measure velocity, wavelength, absorption, or impedance.[2-3] It can also be used for measuring the acoustic attenuation coefficient of the medium, but the accuracy is not high. [10] 
A vibrating crystal creates the ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed parallel to the crystal. The waves are then reflected back to the source and measured.

Optical IS are used for measuring optical wavelength of spectral lines, refractive index of transparent media[4], absolute and relative measurements of length[5-7], angular diameter of objects in the sky [8], testing the quality of surfaces in the optical industry[9].

Principle of operation. Fundamental princilples.
The principles behind all types of IS are very similar. However there is just difference in coherent waves getting and in measurable value. A single beam of light will be split into two or more coherent beams by some kind of splitter device. Each of these beams travels a different optical route and are recombined before arriving a detector. Finally the result of interference between them are shown on a screen. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend on many parameters: the method of the beam splitting into coherent beams, amount of interfering beams, the difference in optical distance, light intensity, the nature of the light source, the spectrum of the light.

Techniques of a coherent waves producing in IS are very various therefore many IS construtcions are exist. Optical IS can be divided into two-wave interferometers and multibeam interferometers by the number of interfering beams. Multibeam IS are used as an interference spectrum analyzer for spectral composition of light. Two-wave IS are used as an interference spectrum analyzer and an device for physical measurements.

Michelson interferometer is an example for the two-wave IS (Figure 1. from [1]). 

A Michelson interferometer consists of two highly polished mirrors M1 and M2. A source L emits light that goes through lens O1 and hits semitransparent plate P1 that splits beam into two coherent waves 1 and 2.  
P1 is partially reflective, so one beam is transmitted through to point B while the other is reflected in the direction of C. 
These beams are reflected by the mirrors M1 and M2. Then they go back in direction A but beam 2 goes through semitransparent plate P1 and beam 1 are reflected by it and after transmission of the semitransparent plate they join again. Both beams goes through lens O2 and produce an interference pattern visible to the observer at point D.

Observed interference pattern is equal to interference in air produced by mirror M2 and virtual pattern M'1 of mirror M2 on semitransparent plate P1.

The difference in optical distance is equal to D=2(AC-АВ)=2l, where l — distance between M2 and M'1. 
If the mirror M1 is set in such way that M'1 is parallel to M2, then stripes of equal slope are appeared in the focal plane of the lens O2. If M2 and M'1 form optical wedge then  stripes of equal depth are appeared in the plane M2M'1.

The Michelson interferometer is used in physical measurements and engineering instruments. Using it for the first time absolute value of light wavelength was measured. And the speed light independence of the orientation of the apparatus are proved (Michelson–Morley experiment, [11]). 

Michelson spectrographs are capable of very high spectral resolution observations of very bright sources (Fourier transform spectroscopy, [12]). This is just a Michelson interferometer with a movable mirror. By making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror, the spectrum can be reconstructed using a Fourier transform of the temporal coherence of the light.  The Michelson or Fourier transform spectrograph was popular for infra-red applications at a time when infra-red astronomy only had single pixel detectors. Imaging Michelson spectrometers are a possibility, but in general have been supplanted by imaging Fabry–Pérot instruments which are easier to construct.


The combination of a Michelson interferometer with a prism monochromator is Köster's interference comparator. In Köster’s interferometer as shown in figure 2 (from [1]), precision Köster’s double prism is used as the beam splitter and combiner. Köster’s interferometer has advantages than Michelson interferometer in being one dimension and a compensating plate is not necessary to get the same optical paths.

Köster’s interferometer is used for the length measurements in absolute or relative values. For some kind of measurements Köster’s interferometer can be used in combination with a laser, with a microscope (V. P. Linnik microinterferometer).

Twobeam interferometers, called interferential refractometers, developed for very exact measurements of the refractive index and dispersion of gases. An example of such devices is Jamin interferometer eloped in 1856 by the French physicist Jules Jamin. (Figure 3, from [1]).

The interferometer is made up of two mirrors, made of the thickest glass possible. The Fresnel reflection from the first surface of the mirror acts as a beam splitter. The incident light is split into two rays, parallel to each other and displaced by an amount depending on the thickness of the mirror. The rays are recombined at the second mirror, and ultimately imaged onto a screen.
If a phase-shifting element is added to one arm of the interferometer, then the displacement it causes can be determined by simply counting the interference fringes (e.g., the minima).

Variants of the Jamin interferometer is the Mach-Zehnder(Figure 4, from [1]), which is invented over one hundred years ago and still used for many optical measurements and studies of air and gas dynamics. 
The Michelson interferometer is a Mach–Zehnder interferometer that has been folded back upon itself. The principal difference is that in the Michelson interferometer, the beam splitting optic is also used to recombine the beams [13].

Another twobeam interferomter is the Rayleigh interferometer (Figure 5, from [1]). The advantage of the Rayleigh interferometer is its simple construction. Its drawbacks are:
- it requires a point or line source of light for good fringe visibility
- the fringes must be viewed with high magnification.[14]

In the Rayleigh interferometer (Figure 5), the interfering beams are separated by two slit diaphragms D. After passing through the cells C1 and C2, the beams are collected in the focal plane by the objective 02, where the interference pattern consisting of equal-inclination fringes forms; it is viewed through the eye-piece O3. In this case, parts of the beams emerging from the diaphragms pass below the cells and form an interference pattern of their own, which is located below the first pattern. A difference between the indexes of refraction n1 and n2 of the materials in the cells leads to a displacement of the upper pattern with respect to the lower. The quantity Δ n may be determined from the magnitude of displacement in terms of the number of fringes m.
